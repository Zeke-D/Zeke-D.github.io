          <p>Connected actually started as an idea between my cousin and I to create an app that
             got people together in groups in the real world. Over the past year the idea got thrown back and forth, 
            hashed and rehashed, scrapped and restarted until we finally decided to start developing it. 
            I also used this opportunity to teach my cousin how to code.
            <br><br>
            I used React Native (including ES2019 standards, JSX, JavaScript, styling via CSS) to develop the app.
            The backend is ran with NodeJS and Express. We are using MongoDB for database management and are currently 
            implementing OAuth 2.0 Authentication standards.</p>

        <div class='accordionContent threeGrid'>
          <p>For UI prototyping, I used Adobe Xd, which is virtually identical to Figma
            or Sketch and many other prototyping apps. Here you can see the final result after many many many iterations later.
          </p>

          <img class="tutImg" src="../imgs/Connected/UI-proto.png" alt="UI Prototype outline"/>
          <p>So this is the final UI design after many many iterations. It has support for dark and light mode,
            a page for each app screen, screen selection, and loading screens. A cool benefit of using a prototyping app
            (as opposed to just making a bunch of Illustrator Artboards or whatever) is that you can actually playtest it.
            Here is a demo of the app's functionality rendered entirely through Adobe Xd:

          <p>
            It was an impressive start that I was really happy to accomplish, but it wasn't a functional app.
            This provided me practically everything I needed to develop the mobile app "for-realsies".

          <p>
            When I started this project, I really wanted a way to learn more about mobile development.
            I thought initially I wanted to use Swift and make a strictly iOS app. And while there is a lot of power
            in using a language normalized for a specific architecture, like Apple's Swift or Objective-C, it felt both:
            <ol class="pList" type="a">
              <li>Very limiting to my intended user-base</li>
              <li>Like a sledgehammer to drive in a nail</li>
            </ol>
            With those languages, if I wanted Android users, I'd have to redevelop the app in Kotlin or something, and that sounded
            like a real pain. Instead, I decided to explore this newer language I had heard about called React Native.
            React Native is basically a way to program apps using React-style syntax and have it compile down to run natively
            on whatever machine was running it. It sounds awesome, right? You never have to develop twice again. But do note there are 
            some serious drawbacks:
            <ol class="pList">
              <li>You have very little performance control.</li>
              <li>The app is rendered in a container, which limits the interaction you have with the hardware.</li>
              <li>It can be a little "block-boxy", in that there is not a whole lot of transparency.</li>
            </ol>
            With that being said, I didn't really need high performance or to talk to the hardware specifically, so this was
            a perfect use-case for react-native. 
            <br><br>
            Here is the current status of the app, running entirely on a simulated iPhone:

        But also who cares, use my template code if you think it's cool.<br>
        It'd be nice if you credited me in a code comment :)
